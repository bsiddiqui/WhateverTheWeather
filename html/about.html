			In this visualization, we explore climate change across cities in the United States! On the visualization's home page, 
			you'll be greeted with a map (powered by Google Maps) with circles for major United States cities.  You can use the
			filtering tools in the map's right pane to adjust the year of the data.  (Also, feel free to pan around the map and 
			glance at the right hand side to see statistics for the region you are currently viewing!)
		</p>
		<p>
			We hope that the initial map view proves to be a springboard for further exploration, allowing you to tenatively
			explore various statistics of interest.  For a more detailed look at the change in climate, though, you may consider
			<ul>
				<li><b>Clicking on one of the cities.</b>  A modal window will pop up, containing line graphs for 
				    various temperature statistics.  You can brush around the graph here, and see some average statistics, 
				    and focus the graph too!</li>
				<li><b>Using the comparison tool.</b>  You can compare two cities' average temperature data to explore
				    relative trends in both a stacked area graph and a multi-series line graph.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>We hope you enjoy our visualization!</p>
